### Variables

---

```matlab
a=100
clc - clear screen
clear a --> a variable is cleared, clear all --> clear everything

c=1:10 --> 1 to 10 stored in c 10*1 matrix
size(c) --> rows and columns of a matrix

a=1:2:10 --> 2 is step value
```

#### Basic Operations

---

- `a\b` --> Means b divided by a   
- `^` --> power operator  
- `f=A.*B` --> Used for scalar multiplication of two matrices (each value in A multiplied with corresponding element in B)
